GstPEAQ - Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------

GstPEAQ uses the autotools infrastructure for building, so ideally

./configure
make
make install

should work. However, this will place the built GStreamer plugin in the default
location (usually /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-0.10 or
/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0, depending on the GStreamer version being built
against) which may not be in the plugin search path. This can be overcome in
two ways:
* Add the install location to the search path by setting GST_PLUGIN_PATH or
  specifying the --gst-plugin-path command line parameter, assuming the invoked
  executable supports it (e.g. both peaq and gst-launch do).
* Install in the proper location by specifying --libdir (or --exec-prefix or
  --prefix) when invoking configure. Assuming a standard GStreamer
  installation, any of --libdir=/usr/lib, --exec-prefix=/usr, or --prefix=/usr
  should work, differing in where the peaq executable and the documentation are
  stored.
Additionally, you may find the --with-html-dir option of configure useful to
install the HTML documentation in a directors different from the default
(/usr/local/share/gtk-doc/html/gstpeaq).

Of course, development files of GStreamer, including the base libraries
and the FFT library, are needed for the build. Both GStreamer API versions 0.10
and 1.0 are supported. If both are available, configure by default prefers 1.0,
but --with-gstreamer=0.10 or --with-gstreamer=1.0 may be used to enforce a
specific API version to use.

For active development of GstPEAQ, the --enable-gtk-doc and --enable-man
options of configure may be useful to enable rebuilding of the documentation,
as well as the --with-conformance-dataset=DIR option that enables verification
of the conformance results if the required WAV files (to be obtained from the
ITU) are provided in the given directory.

Further documentation of the build process is left to the autotools
documentation.
