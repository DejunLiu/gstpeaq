.SH DESCRIPTION
.B peaq
evaluates the audio quality of an impaired
.I TESTFILE
with reference to the original
.IR REFFILE .
The output consists of the Objective Difference Grade (ODG) and the Distortion
Index (DI).
The ODG approximates the result of a listening test with a five-grade
impairment scale, where the possible values are anchored accoring to:
.TS
tab (@);
r lx.
ODG@T{
judgement of impairment
T}
0@T{

T}
-1@T{
perceptible but not annoying
T}
-2@T{
slightly annoying
T}
-3@T{
annoying
T}
-4@T{
very annoying
T}
.TE

The calculation of the ODG is performed as described in ITU-R BS.1387-1 and
interpreted by Peter Kabal in "An Examination and Interpretation of ITU-R
BS.1387: Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality".
