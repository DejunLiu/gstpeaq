Version 0.6
===========

Important user visible changes:
* Two bugs were fixed where only the first channel of the audio data was used
  during MOV computation. This did change the results on the conformance
  dataset a little bit.
* Both Gstreamer API versions 0.10 and 1.0 are now supported (to be chosen at
  compile time).
